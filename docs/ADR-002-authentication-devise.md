# ADR 002 â€“ Authentication with Devise

**Status:** Accepted  

## Context

Security and maintainability are priorities.

## Rationale

- Built-in mailer and password recovery features.  
- Minimal setup effort and strong documentation.

## Consequences
- Adds dependency on Devise/Warden.  
- Requires SMTP configuration (SendGrid) for production.  
- Simplifies authentication flow and user management.
