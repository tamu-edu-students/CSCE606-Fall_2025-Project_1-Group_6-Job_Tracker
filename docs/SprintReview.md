## **Sprint Review**

During the Sprint review meetings, we demonstrated all completed features and discussed progress against the sprint backlog.
Major accomplishments showcased:

* **Authentication module:** Sign-up, login/logout, password reset (Devise).
* **Profile management:** Edit profile, upload profile picture.
* **Job management:** CRUD functionality for job applications, dropdown-based status tracking, CSV import, and Kanban-style dashboard view.
* **UI Enhancements:** Consistent buttons across pages, navbar updates, footer fixes, and improved navigation.
* **Functional improvements:** Job search (with JavaScript and non-JS fallback), job sorting by date/company/status, and color-coded status badges.
* **Reminders and Notifications:** Email-based deadline reminders integrated with background jobs.
* **Testing and CI/CD:** RSpec and Cucumber tests added for user flows; app deployed successfully on Heroku.

All the **Sprint goals were met**, with all key user stories completed and merged into `main` after review.
